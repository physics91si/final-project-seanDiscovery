# Modeling relativistic effects near a Schwarzschild black hole

Explore how gravitational time dilation and time dilation from relativistic speeds interact for a massive particle near a Schwarzschild black hole. 

Initially, we'll compare the following systems: 

-A particle at rest a distance r from the event horizon of a Schw. black hole 

-A particle moving at a relativistic speed in the absence of a gravitational field 

-A particle moving at a radial relativstic speed at an instantaneous distance r from the EH of a Schw. black hole 

This code is very simple, and is included in time_dilation.py. The iPython notebook time_dilation_test has some simple plots that shows the relative strength of these effects for the same particle. 

The file massive_particle.py is setup for a more sophisticated black hole simulation tool. Ideally, we'd like to simulate the gravitational potential of a Schw. black hole, making a simple animation showing (a) the trajectory of a particle with a given initial velocity around the black hole, and (b) a trace of the time dilation of this particle, relative to a fixed observer at a large distance from the black hole.
